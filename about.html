    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Colin, an undergraduate student at Kutztown University. I have a passion for technology, both hardware and software.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I started my journey in Software Development and have since developed skills in Python, C++, C, SQL, Visual Studio Code, Mac OS, and many other tools. Over the years, I've worked on a range of projects, from creating a client for a chat room program to the Pacman projects from UC Berkeley.</p>

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>Outside of work, I enjoy gaming, music, and reading. I believe in continuous learning and try to improve myself both personally and professionally.</p>
